# Oven-Alert-System üå°Ô∏è‚ö°

Welcome to the **Oven-Alert-System** project! This is a web-based real-time temperature and power failure alert system for industrial test ovens, developed by [Salitha](https://github.com/salithaisuranga) and **Adheesha**. 

## Introduction üìö

In industrial and laboratory settings, maintaining precise temperature control in heating ovens is essential for ensuring product quality, safety, and operational efficiency. Overheating can lead to significant damage, safety hazards, and compromised product integrity, making it crucial to monitor temperature levels continuously. Traditional temperature monitoring systems often rely on manual checks and do not provide timely alerts or remote-control capabilities, which can be particularly problematic during off-hours or in critical situations.

The Heating Oven Alert System addresses these challenges by integrating a range of modern technologies to create a comprehensive monitoring and control solution. This system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller, a real-time clock (RTC) module, a GSM module, a DHT11 sensor, relay modules, and a rechargeable battery with a charging module. The core functionality of the system includes real-time temperature monitoring, alert notifications via SMS and phone calls, and remote-control capabilities through a web interface.

## Objectives üéØ

- üì≤ Send an alert message and call if the temperature exceeds 35¬∞C.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Accurately identify communication errors caused by power interruption.

## Apparatus üõ†Ô∏è

- ESP32 microcontroller
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- GSM Module
- RTC Module (DS 3231)
- Relay Module (One channel)
- Charging module
- Rechargeable battery (9V)
- Connecting Wires
- Breadboard
- 12V power supply
- 2 LEDs

## Problem Statement ‚ùì

Maintaining a consistent and safe temperature within industrial ovens is crucial for ensuring product quality and safety. When temperatures exceed a specific threshold, immediate action is required to prevent potential damage or hazards. Traditional monitoring systems often rely on manual intervention and lack real-time alerts or remote-control capabilities. Additionally, power interruptions can lead to communication failures, complicating the diagnosis of such issues without effective logging. The current system fails to provide real-time monitoring and alerts for temperature deviations, lacks remote control functionality for emergency situations, does not log power interruptions for troubleshooting, and offers no user-friendly interface for managing the system remotely. These limitations jeopardize product quality, safety, and operational efficiency, highlighting the need for an integrated system that offers real-time monitoring, remote control, and comprehensive logging to address these critical challenges.
